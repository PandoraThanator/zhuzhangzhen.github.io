    <strong>Zhangzhen Zhu</strong>, Yongliang Lin, Yu Zhang </p>

    <p>
        <strong>RSETC</strong> (robust self event-triggered control) is a computationally efficient and robust control policy for invertible nonlinear
        systems, it ensures robust performance under various perturbations and alleviating communication
        burden simultaneously. A novel fully actuated multirotors applied this method shows great
        robustness to perturbations and is able of tracking six dimensional decoupled trajectories
        without continuous background sensor monitoring.
