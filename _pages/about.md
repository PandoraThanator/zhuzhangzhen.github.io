 I am Zhangzhen Zhu (Êú±Âº†Ëµà), a Ph.D. Candidate at ZheJiang University, with the State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology,
College of Control Science and Engineering. My research interests lie in the areas of robust and nonlinear control, in particular, with emphasis on Adaptive High Order Sliding Mode Control/Observer, Time-Varying Input Delay Systems/ Nonlinear Model Predictive Control, Discrete-Time Event-Triggered Control and their applications to complex real systems, including unmanned aerial vehicles and brushless DC motors (see my Publication list for details). 

 In addition to my academic pursuits, I also possess extensive experience in the development of complex Mechatronic systems from scratch (see my Projects list for details), including mechanical system realization, circuit system customization, system modeling and identification, and efficient code deployment. I believe that the familiarity with the hardware systems will effectively enhance control engineers' comprehension of the theoretical research, and to a certain extent, eliminate vacuous mathematical academic research in the control society.
 
 I am dedicated to producing high-quality research and making meaningful contributions to both academics and industrial societies, and looking forward to making progress together with an excellent team.

      <div class="article-style">
        <strong>ImMesh</strong> is a novel LiDAR(-inertial) odometry and meshing framework, which takes advantage of input of LiDAR data, achieving the goal of <strong>simultaneous localization and meshing</strong> in real-time. ImMesh comprises four tightly-coupled modules: <em>receiver</em>, <em>localization</em>, <em>meshing</em>, and <em>broadcaster</em>. The <em>localization</em> module utilizes the prepossessed sensor data from the <em>receiver</em>, estimates the sensor pose online by registering LiDAR scans to maps, and dynamically grows the map. Then, our <em>meshing</em> module takes the registered LiDAR scan for <strong>incrementally reconstructing the triangle mesh on the fly</strong>. Finally, the real-time odometry, map, and mesh are published via our <em>broadcaster</em>.
