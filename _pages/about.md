 I am Zhangzhen Zhu (æœ±å¼ èµˆ), a Ph.D. Candidate at ZheJiang University, with the State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology,
College of Control Science and Engineering. My research interests lie in the areas of robust and nonlinear control, in particular, with emphasis on Adaptive High Order Sliding Mode Control/Observer, Time-Varying Input Delay Systems/ Nonlinear Model Predictive Control, Discrete-Time Event-Triggered Control and their applications to complex real systems, including unmanned aerial vehicles and brushless DC motors (see my Publication list for details). 

 In addition to my academic pursuits, I also possess extensive experience in the development of complex Mechatronic systems from scratch (see my Projects list for details), including mechanical system realization, circuit system customization, system modeling and identification, and efficient code deployment. I believe that the familiarity with the hardware systems will effectively enhance control engineers' comprehension of the theoretical research, and to a certain extent, eliminate vacuous mathematical academic research in the control society.
 
 I am dedicated to producing high-quality research and making meaningful contributions to both academics and industrial societies, and looking forward to making progress together with an excellent team.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
